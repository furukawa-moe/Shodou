# Shodou
Permissive Kanji mnemonic database and build system.

We use Kanji component data collected from https://github.com/scriptin/topokanji and graphics provided by https://github.com/KanjiVG/kanjivg (thanks!)

## What?
Shodou aims to provide a database of friendly and effective mnemonics to help learners of Japanese study Kanji - the "Chinese" portion of the written language.

## Why?
Resources like Remembering the Kanji, WaniKani, JPDB.io, etc. are *extremely helpful* in associating concepts to Kanji characters. Unfortunately, each of these come with some kind of flaw - being stuck behind a paywall, not being comprehensive in their coverage, or just plain using bad mnemonics that don't do much to stick in your brain. I truly believe a collaborative approach is needed to this problem because eventually, one person is going to give up coming up with a system for describing 2,000+ pictograms that's actually useful for the vast majority of people.

I want to make a complete collection that you could download, print into a book and sell for as much as you want. We don't ask for anything in return. *other than adherance to the license, via attribution and releasing a free digital copy for example :)*

## How?

git is a good start, and having a convenient piece of software that will let you quickly make changes and see how they fit within the context of other radicals/characters makes things a lot easier. I'll dream up guidelines for submission quality soon.
